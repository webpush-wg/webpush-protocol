      <t>
        A simple protocol for the delivery of realtime events to user agents is
        described.  This scheme uses HTTP/2 server push.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Many applications on mobile and embedded devices require continuous
        access to network communications so that real-time events - such as
        incoming calls or messages - can be delivered (or "pushed") in a timely
        fashion. These devices typically have limited power reserves, so finding
        more efficient ways to serve application requirements greatly benefits
        the application ecosystem.
      </t>
      <t>
        One significant contributor to power usage is the radio.  Radio
        communications consume a significant portion of the energy budget
        on a wireless device.
      </t>
      <t>
        Uncoordinated use of persistent connections or sessions from multiple
        applications can contribute to unnecessary use of the device radio,
        since each independent session independently incurs overheads.  In
        particular, keep alive traffic used to ensure that middleboxes do not
        prematurely time out sessions, can result in significant waste.
        Maintenance traffic tends to dominate over the long term, since events
        are relatively rare.
      </t>
      <t>
        Consolidating all real-time events into a single session ensures more
        efficient use of network and radio resources.  A single service
        consolidates all events, distributing those events to applications as
        they arrive.  This requires just one session, avoiding duplicated
        overhead costs.
      </t>
      <t>
        The <xref target="API">W3C Web Push API</xref> describes an API that
        enables the use of a consolidated push service from web applications.
        This expands on that work by describing a protocol that can be used to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            request the delivery of a push message to a user agent,
          </t>
          <t>
            create new push message delivery subscriptions, and
          </t>
          <t>
            monitor for new push messages.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Requesting the delivery of events is particularly important for the Web
        Push API.  The subscription, management and monitoring functions are
        currently fulfilled by proprietary protocols; these are adequate, but do
        not offer any of the advantages that standardization affords.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document intentionally does not describe how a push service is
        discovered.  Discovery of push services is left for future efforts, if
        it turns out to be necessary at all.  User agents are expected to be
        configured with a URL for a push service.
      </t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Conventions and Terminology">
        <t>
          In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
          document falls back on established shorthands for expressing
          interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
          words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these is
          described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document defines the following terms:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="application:">
              Both the sender and ultimate consumer of push messages.  Many
              applications have components that are run on a user agent and
              other components that run on servers.
            </t>
            <t hangText="application server:">
              The component of an application that runs on a server and requests
              the delivery of a push message.
            </t>
            <t hangText="push message subscription:">
              A message delivery context that is established between the user
              agent and the push service and shared with the application server.
              All push messages are associated with a push message subscription.
            </t>
            <t hangText="push message subscription set:">
              A message delivery context that is established between the user
              agent and the push service that collects multiple push message
              subscriptions into a set.
            </t>
            <t hangText="push message:">
              A message sent from an application server to a user agent via a
              push service.
            </t>
            <t hangText="push message receipt:">
              A message delivery confirmation sent from the push service to the

            <t hangText="user agent:">
              A device and software that is the recipient of push messages.

        <t>
          Examples in this document use the <xref target="RFC7230">HTTP/1.1
          message format</xref>.  Many of the exchanges can be completed using
          HTTP/1.1, where HTTP/2 is necessary, the more verbose frame format
          from <xref target="RFC7540"/> is used.

      <t>
        At the very beginning of the process, a new  message subscription is
        created by the user agent and then distributed to its application
        server. This subscription is the basis of all future interactions between
        the actors.
      </t>
      <t>
        To offer more control for authorization, a message subscription is
        modeled as two resources with different capabilities:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A subscription resource is used to receive messages from a
            subscription and to delete a subscription. It is private to the user
            agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            A push resource is used to send messages to a subscription. It is
            public and shared by the user agent with its application server.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        It is expected that a unique subscription will be distributed to each
        application; however, there are no inherent cardinality constraints in
        the protocol.  Multiple subscriptions might be created for the same
        application, or multiple applications could use the same subscription.
        Note however that sharing subscriptions has security and privacy
        implications.
      </t>
      <t>
        Subscriptions have a limited lifetime.  They can also be terminated by
        either the push service or user agent at any time. User agents and
        application servers must be prepared to manage changes in subscription
        state.
      </t>

      <section anchor="resources" title="HTTP Resources">

          This protocol uses <xref target="RFC7230">HTTP resources</xref> and

            <t hangText="push service:">
              This resource is used to create push message subscriptions (see

              messages</xref> using a push message subscription.  Every push
              message subscription has exactly one push resource associated with
              it.
            </t>
            <t hangText="push message subscription set:">
              This resource provides read and delete access for a collection of push
              message subscriptions. A user agent <xref target="monitor-set">receives

              link relation of type "urn:ietf:params:push:set" identifies a push message
              subscription set.
            </t>
            <t hangText="push:">
              A push resource is used by the application server to request the

      <t>
        The push service shares the same default port number (443/TCP) with HTTPS, but MAY
        also advertise the IANA allocated TCP System Port 1001 using HTTP alternative services
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc"/>:
      </t>
      <t>
        While the default port (443) offers broad reachability characteristics, it is most
        often used for web browsing scenarios with a lower idle timeout than other ports
        configured in middleboxes. For webpush scenarios, this would contribute to unnecessary
        radio communications to maintain the connection on battery-powered devices.
      </t>
      <t>
        Advertising the alternate port (1001) allows middleboxes to optimize idle timeouts
        for connections specific to push scenarios with the expectation that data exchange will be
        infrequent.
      </t>
      <t>
        Middleboxes SHOULD comply with REQ-5 in <xref target="RFC5382"/> which requires that
        "the value of the 'established connection idle-timeout' MUST NOT be less than
        2 hours 4 minutes".

      <t>
        The push service MUST provide a URI for the push resource corresponding

        An application-specific method is used to distribute the push and
        receipt subscribe URIs to the application server.  Confidentiality
        protection and application server authentication MUST be used to ensure
        that these URIs are not disclosed to unauthorized recipients (see <xref

      </t>
      <t>
        The push service MAY provide a URI for a subscription set resource in a
        link relation of type "urn:ietf:params:push:set". If provided, the push
        service supports subscription sets. If available, the user agent SHOULD
        use the subscription set to receive push messages rather than individual
        push message subscriptions.
      </t>
      <t>
        The push service MAY return new subscription sets in response to different
        subscription requests from the same user agent. This allows the push service to

        <t>
          The aggregation of multiple subscriptions into a subscription set can
          represent a significant efficiency improvement for a push service.
          For that reason, if a subscription set is available, a user agent MUST
          indicate an existing subscription set in a request to create a
          subscription.  However, a user agent MAY omit the subscription set if
          it is unable to receive push messages that are aggregated for the
          lifetime of the subscription.  This might be necessary if the user
          agent is forwarding requests from other clients.
        </t>
        <t>
          The user agent adds a subscription set link relation to the request to
          create a subscription.  This indicates which subscription set the
          subscription is to be bound to.

          This gives the push service the option to create a subscription within

          set if it is unable to reuse the provided one.

        A push service MAY reject a request if it contains an unknown or invalid
        subscription set, or a request that does not include a subscription set.
        An 429 status code can be used to indicate that too many requests to
        create subscriptions sets were made.
      </t>
      <t>
        How a push service detects that requests come from the same user agent
        is implementation-dependent and could take ambient information into
        consideration, such as the TLS connection, source IP address and port.
        Implementers are reminded that using some heuristics can produce false
        positives and cause requests to be rejected incorrectly.

      <t>
        An application server that sends push messages to a large population of
        user agents incurs a significant load if it has to monitor a receipt
        subscription for each user agent.  Reuse of receipt subscriptions is
        critical in reducing load on application servers.  A receipt
        subscription can be used for all resources that have the same receipt
        subscribe URI.
      </t>
      <t>
        A push service SHOULD provide the same receipt subscribe URI to all user
        agents.  Application servers SHOULD reuse receipt subscription URIs if
        the receipt subscribe URI provided with the push resource is identical
        to the one used to create the receipt subscription.  Checking that the
        receipt subscribe URI is identical allows the application server to
        avoid creating unnecessary receipt subscriptions.

          An application server can use the Push-Receipt header field to request
          a confirmation from the push service when a push message is delivered
          and acknowledged by the user agent. The Push-Receipt header field is a
          URI-Reference as defined in Section 2.7 of
          <xref target="RFC7230"/>.

        <t>
          The application sets the Push-Receipt header field value to a receipt
          subscription URI.  This receipt subscription resource MUST be created
          from the same receipt subscribe resource which was returned with the
          push message subscription response (see <xref

      <section anchor="ttl" title="Push Message Time-To-Live">
        <t>
          A push service can improve the reliability of push message delivery
          considerably by storing push messages for a period.  User agents are
          often only intermittently connected, and so benefit from having short
          term message storage at the push service.
        </t>
        <t>
          Delaying delivery might also be used to batch communication with the
          user agent, thereby conserving radio resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          Some push messages are not useful once a certain period of time
          elapses.  Delivery of messages after they have ceased to be relevant
          is wasteful.  For example, if the push message contains a call
          notification, receiving a message after the caller has abandoned the
          call is of no value; the application at the user agent is forced to
          suppress the message so that it does not generate a useless alert.
        </t>
        <t>
          An application server can use the TTL header field to limit the time
          that a push message is retained by a push service.  The TTL header
          field contains a value in seconds that describes how long a push
          message is retained by the push service.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[
TTL = 1*DIGIT
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          Once the Time-To-Live (TTL) period elapses, the push service MUST NOT
          attempt to deliver the push message to the user agent.  A push service
          might adjust the TTL value to account for time accounting errors in
          processing.  For instance, distributing a push message within a server
          cluster might accrue errors due to clock skew or propagation delays.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service is not obligated to account for time spent by the
          application server in sending a push message to the push service, or
          delays incurred while sending a push message to the user agent.  An
          application server needs to account for transit delays in selecting a
          TTL header field value.
        </t>
        <t>
          Absence of the TTL header field is interpreted as equivalent to a zero
          value.  A Push message with a zero TTL is immediately delivered if the
          user agent is available to receive the message. After delivery, the push
          service is permitted to immediately remove a push message with a zero TTL.
          This might occur before the user agent acknowledges receipt of the message
          by performing a HTTP DELETE on the push message resource. Consequently, an
          application server cannot rely on receiving acknowledgement receipts for
          zero TTL push messages.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the user agent is unavailable, a push message with a zero TTL expires and
          is never delivered.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service MAY choose to retain a push message for a shorter
          duration than that requested.  It indicates this by including a TTL
          header field in the response that includes the actual TTL.  This TTL
          value MUST be less than or equal to the value provided by the
          application server.

        A user agent requests the delivery of new push messages by making a GET
        request to a push message subscription resource.  The push service does
        not respond to this request, it instead uses <xref

        contents of push messages as they are sent by application servers.

        message delivery.  The response headers SHOULD provide a URI for the push
        resource corresponding to the push message subscription in a link relation
        of type "urn:ietf:params:push". The response body is the entity body from
        the most recent request sent to the push resource by the application server.

          the push service ceases to retry delivery of the message prior to its advertised

      <section anchor="load" title="Load Management">
        <t>
          A push service is likely to have to maintain a very large number of open
          TCP connections.  Effective management of those connections can depend
          on being able to move connections between server instances.
        </t>
        <t>
          A user agent MUST support the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code
          <xref target="RFC7231"/>, which can be used by a push service to
          redistribute load at the time that a new subscription is requested.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server that wishes to redistribute load can do so using alternative
          services <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc"/>.  Alternative
          services allows for redistribution of load whilst maintaining the same
          URIs for various resources.  User agents can ensure a graceful
          transition by using the GOAWAY frame once it has established a
          replacement connection.

      <section anchor="storage" title="Push Message Expiration">
        <t>
          Storage of push messages based on the TTL header field comprises a
          potentially significant amount of storage for a push service.  A push
          service is not obligated to store messages indefinitely.  A push
          service is able to indicate how long it intends to retain a message to
          an application server using the TTL header field (see <xref
          target="ttl"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          A user agent that does not actively monitor for push messages will not
          receive messages that expire during that interval.
        </t>
        <t>
          Push messages that are stored and not delivered to a user agent are
          delivered when the user agent recommences monitoring.  Stored push
          messages SHOULD include a Last-Modified header field (see Section 2.2
          of <xref target="RFC7232"/>) indicating when delivery was requested by
          an application server.
        </t>
        <t>
          A GET request to a push message subscription resource that has only
          expired messages results in response as though no push message were
          ever sent.
        </t>
        <t>
          Push services might need to limit the size and number of stored push
          messages to avoid overloading.  To limit the size of messages, the
          push service MAY return the 413 (Payload Too Large) status code for messages
          that are too large. To limit the number of stored push messages, the
          push service MAY either expire messages prior to their advertised Time-To-Live
          or reduce their advertised Time-To-Live.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="delete" title="Subscription Expiration">
        <t>
          In some cases, it may be necessary to terminate subscriptions so that
          they can be refreshed.  This applies to both push message
          subscriptions and receipt subscriptions.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service can remove a subscription at any time. If a user agent
          or application server has an outstanding request to a subscription
          resource (see <xref target="monitor-subscription"/>), this can be signaled by
          returning a 400-series status code, such as 410 (Gone).
        </t>
        <t>
          A user agent or application server can request that a subscription be
          removed by sending a DELETE request to the push message subscription
          or receipt subscription URI.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service MUST return a 400-series status code, such as 404 (Not
          Found) or 410 (Gone) if an application server attempts to send a push
          message to a removed or expired push message subscription.
        </t>
        <section title="Subscription Set Expiration">
          <t>
            A push service MAY expire a subscription set at any time which MUST also
            expire all push message subscriptions in the set. If a user agent has an
            outstanding request to a push subscription set (see <xref target="monitor-set"/>)
            this can be signaled by returning a 400-series status code, such as 410 (Gone).
          </t>
          <t>
            A user agent can request that a subscription set be removed by sending a DELETE
            request to the subscription set URI. This MUST also remove all push message
            subscriptions in the set.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a specific push message subscription that is a member of a subscription set is
            expired or removed, then it MUST also be removed from its subscription set.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Implications for Application Reliability">
        <t>
          A push service that does not support reliable delivery over
          intermittent network connections or failing applications on devices,
          forces the device to acknowledge receipt directly to the application
          server, incurring additional power drain in order to establish
          (usually secure) connections to the individual application servers.
        </t>
        <t>
          Push message reliability can be important if messages contain
          information critical to the state of an application.  Repairing state
          can be costly, particularly for devices with limited communications
          capacity.  Knowing that a push message has been correctly received
          avoids costly retransmissions, polling and state resynchronization.
        </t>
        <t>
          The availability of push message delivery receipts ensures that the
          application developer is not tempted to create alternative mechanisms
          for message delivery in case the push service fails to deliver a
          critical message. Setting up a polling mechanism or a backup messaging
          channel in order to compensate for these shortcomings negates almost
          all of the advantages a push service provides.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, reliability might not be necessary for messages that are
          transient (e.g. an incoming call) or messages that are quickly
          superceded (e.g. the current number of unread emails).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sets-streams" title="Subscription Sets and Concurrent HTTP/2 streams">
        <t>
          If the push service requires that the user agent use push message subscription sets,
          then it MAY limit the number of concurrently active streams with the
          SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter within a HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame <xref target="RFC7540"/>.
          The user agent MAY be limited to one concurrent stream to manage push message
          subscriptions and one concurrent stream for each subscription set returned by the push service.
          This could force the user agent to serialize subscription requests to the push
          service.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        This protocol MUST use <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS</xref>.
        This includes any communications between user agent and push service,
        plus communications between the application and the push service.  All
        URIs therefore use the "https" scheme.  This provides confidentiality
        and integrity protection for subscriptions and push messages from
        external parties.
      </t>

      <section title="Confidentiality from Push Service Access">
        <t>
          The protection afforded by TLS does not protect content from the push
          service.  Without additional safeguards, a push service is able to see
          and modify the content of the messages.
        </t>
        <t>
          Applications are able to provide additional confidentiality, integrity
          or authentication mechanisms within the push message itself.  The
          application server sending the push message and the application on the
          user agent that receives it are frequently just different instances of
          the same application, so no standardized protocol is needed to
          establish a proper security context.  The process of providing the
          application server with subscription information provides a convenient
          medium for key agreement.
        </t>
        <t>
          <!-- Scrub references to specific API(s) -->
          The Web Push API codifies this practice by requiring that each push
          subscription created by the browser be bound to a browser generated
          encryption key.  Pushed messages are authenticated and decrypted by
          the browser before delivery to applications.  This scheme ensures that
          the push service is unable to examine the contents of push messages.
        </t>
        <t>
          The public key for a subscription ensures that applications using that
          subscription can identify messages from unknown sources and discard
          them.  This depends on the public key only being disclosed to entities
          that are authorized to send messages on the channel.  The push service
          does not require access to this public key.
        </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Privacy Considerations">
       <t>
         Push message confidentiality does not ensure that the identity of who
         is communicating and when they are communicating is protected.
         However, the amount of information that is exposed can be limited.
       </t>
       <t>
         The URIs provided for push resources MUST NOT provide any basis to
         correlate communications for a given user agent.  It MUST NOT be
         possible to correlate any two push resource URIs based solely on their
         contents.  This allows a user agent to control correlation across
         different applications, or over time.
       </t>
       <t>
         Similarly, the URIs provided by the push service to identify a push
         message MUST NOT provide any information that allows for correlation
         across subscriptions.  Push message URIs for the same subscription MAY
         contain information that would allow correlation with the associated
         subscription or other push messages for that subscription.
       </t>
       <t>
         User and device information MUST NOT be exposed through a push or push
         message URI.
       </t>
       <t>
         In addition, push URIs established by the same user agent or push
         message URIs for the same subscription MUST NOT include any information
         that allows them to be correlated with the user agent.
         <list style="hanging">
           <t hangText="Note:">
             This need not be perfect as long as the resulting anonymity set
             (see <xref target="RFC6973"/>, Section 6.1.1) is sufficiently
             large.  A push URI necessarily identifies a push service or a
             single server instance.  It is also possible that traffic analysis
             could be used to correlate subscriptions.
           </t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>
         A user agent MUST be able to create new subscriptions with new
         identifiers at any time.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section anchor="authorization" title="Authorization">
       <t>
         This protocol does not define how a push service establishes whether a
         user agent is permitted to create a subscription, or whether push
         messages can be delivered to the user agent.  A push service MAY choose
         to authorize requests based on any HTTP-compatible authorization method
         available, of which there are numerous options.  The authorization
         process and any associated credentials are expected to be configured in
         the user agent along with the URI for the push service.
       </t>
       <t>
         Authorization is managed using capability URLs for the push message
         subscription, push, and receipt subscription resources (see <xref
         target="CAP-URI"/>).  A capability URL grants access to a resource
         based solely on knowledge of the URL.
       </t>
       <t>
         Capability URLs are used for their "easy onward sharing" and "easy
         client API" properties. These make it possible to avoid relying on
         relationships between push services and application servers, with the
         protocols necessary to build and support those relationships.
       </t>
       <t>
         Capability URLs act as bearer tokens.  Knowledge of a push message
         subscription URI implies authorization to either receive push messages
         or delete the subscription. Knowledge of a push URI implies
         authorization to send push messages.  Knowledge of a push message URI
         allows for reading and acknowledging that specific message.  Knowledge
         of a receipt subscription URI implies authorization to receive push
         receipts.  Knowledge of a receipt subscribe URI implies authorization
         to create subscriptions for receipts.
       </t>
       <t>
         Note that the same receipt subscribe URI could be returned for multiple
         push message subscriptions.  Using the same value for a large number of
         subscriptions allows application servers to reuse receipt
         subscriptions, which can provide a significant efficiency advantage.  A
         push service that uses a common receipt subscribe URI loses control
         over the creation of receipt subscriptions.  This can result in a
         potential exposure to denial of service; stateless resource creation
         can be used to mitigate the effects of this exposure.
       </t>
       <t>
         Encoding a large amount of random entropy (at least 120 bits) in the
         path component ensures that it is difficult to successfully guess a
         valid capability URL.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Denial of Service Considerations">
       <t>
         Discarding unwanted messages at the user agent based on message
         authentication doesn't protect against a denial of service attack on
         the user agent.  Even a relatively small volume of push messages can
         cause battery-powered devices to exhaust power reserves.
       </t>
       <t>
         An application can limit where valid push messages can originate by
         limiting the distribution of push URIs to authorized entities.
         Ensuring that push URIs are hard to guess ensures that only application
         servers that have been given a push URI can use it.
       </t>
       <t>
         A malicious application with a valid push URI could use the greater
         resources of a push service to mount a denial of service attack on a
         user agent.  Push services SHOULD limit the rate at which push messages
         are sent to individual user agents.  A push service or user agent MAY
         <xref target="delete">terminate subscriptions</xref> that receive too
         many push messages.
       </t>
       <t>
         End-to-end confidentiality mechanisms, such as those in <xref
         target="API"/>, prevent an entity with a valid push message
         subscription URI from learning the contents of push messages.  Push
         messages that are not successfully authenticated will not be delivered
         by the API, but this can present a denial of service risk.
       </t>
       <t>
         Conversely, a push service is also able to deny service to user agents.
         Intentional failure to deliver messages is difficult to distinguish
         from faults, which might occur due to transient network errors,
         interruptions in user agent availability, or genuine service outages.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Logging Risks">
       <t>
         Server request logs can reveal subscription-related URIs. Acquiring a
         push message subscription URI enables the receipt of messages or
         deletion of the subscription. Acquiring a push URI permits the sending
         of push messages.  Logging could also reveal relationships between
         different subscription-related URIs for the same user agent.  Encrypted
         message contents are not revealed to the push service.
       </t>
       <t>
         Limitations on log retention and strong access control mechanisms can
         ensure that URIs are not learned by unauthorized entities.
